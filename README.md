### 1.1 Inspiration

I am at a stage of my study where needs for programming is becoming essential, and natually I start to come across this thing called Github. At first I thought it was like a forum or community where programmers hangout, and spin yarns, but one day I received an seminar notification email from Medhi about [Blakes's Github seminar](https://github.com/sccuoa/intro-to-git) and thought yeah I kept came across this github thing might as well see what is it about. And then I learnt about version control, I wish I knew about and start using github earlier.

What are benefits of incorporating Github with my R projects:

1. Version Control, keep track on your projects and makes it easier to collaborate. 
2. Able to browse and download other peoples shared codes, this is fun.
3. Create a public profile for myself, my github is the first thing that came up in google search if I search my name.
4. An alternative platform which I can do blog/notes, at Uni and at home. It is better than good old microsoft word. 
5. I can quickly present my projects or codes to other people by sending them a github repository link.
6. I Need to use github if I was to create my personal website using R Blogdown.

Some cons

1. I procastinate on github, yeah I open up github and doen't know what to do and just chill there acting as if I am doing stuff.
2. I start worry about my coding abilities and start compare myself to other people. And this usually end up in me thinking I really suck and contemplating about my life. 
3. No spell check, now people will see how bad my spelling really is. Maybe I need to do my markdown files on an editor rather than do it on github. 
4.I am still unfamilar with github and I things ineffecient, if you see me doing like 100 commits in a day, that does not meant I did a lot of work on that day, it probably meant that I was confused and had to keep doing commints to fix things up.
